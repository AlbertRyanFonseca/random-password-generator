# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purpose

This site creates a random password based on user's answers. The application starts with the clicking of the "Generate Password" button. By clicking, it will ask the user the length of the password, from 8-128. It will display the user's number choice, and then ask four question if you want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. It will then display your generated password! In future development, I will display the questions of characters on one screen, easier for user to answer all questions. 

## Usage

1) Go to the link of GitHub Pages.
2) Click "Generate Password" button, answer questions that appear on top, then watch your random password generate in the dotted text box.

## Built With
